# Species Autocomplete for OMERO v2.0

## Overview
The **Species Autocomplete Extension** helps users autocomplete genus and species names on webpages, preventing misspellings and inconsistencies by referencing a preloaded list. The list is updated from a CSV file, which must contain only one column with taxa names and no header.

This extension was created to ensure consistent OMERO tags for palynological taxonomy.

âš  **Currently, the extension ONLY supports Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge.**

- Works on any text input or textarea on any webpage (optimized for OMERO tags).
- Displays suggestions as you type.
- Allows selecting a suggestion by clicking it.
- Suggestions remain visible as you scroll.
- Limits to 15 suggestions at a time for performance optimization.
- Persists the species list across browser sessions.
- Can be activated or deactivated with a button.
- Allows selecting the CSV file separator.
- Displays the number of species loaded (excluding duplicates).
- Prioritizes the last species selected by the user.
